# Minesweeper-CSharp
Basic minesweeper game built in C# using Windows Forms

This is a project I did for school a few years back which I've updated a bit. I've reformatted some code, added comments and improved a couple functions, though most of it is the original. There are definitely some things I'd want to improve if I had rewritten it from scratch again today but overall I think the program strikes a good balance between 'programmability' and overall performance.

## How to play the game
1. Either download the .exe I have provided in the bin folder or download the code and compile it yourself.
2. Select a difficulty
3. On the left you'll see how many bombs you have which is also how many flags you have. Clicking the emoji restarts the game and on the right you'll see a game timer.
4. Left click on tiles to 'open' them and reveal all surrounding tiles without bombs.
5. If a tile is next to a or several bombs it will have a number indicating how many bombs surround it.
6. Right click on tiles to place flags on them.
7. If there is a flag on every bomb (you will use all your flags), you win!
8. If you click on a bomb, you lose!
9. (Psst... if you click on hax, you'll get wallhacks and see all the bombs.)
